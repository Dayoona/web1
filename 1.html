<h2>BTSxAMAs 방탄소년단 and ARMY</h2>
While it may not have been audible to viewers watching through television or streams, the moment the opening notes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdVXkSdhwU" target="_blank" title="DNA Official MV">"DNA"<a> began, Los Angeles' Microsoft Theater was flooded with fans screaming out the band members' names. This was the beginning of what is known as a "fan chant," which fans in Korea use as a way to actively support their favorite artists' performances on television and in concerts. Typically, <strong>the louder the <u>fan chant</u>, the more popular the act</strong> is and it helps audiences at home get a sense of what acts they should be watching. <p>In order to create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript.
