<h2>BTSxAMAs 방탄소년단 and ARMY(2)</h2>
<p>
The first members of BTS were recruited through Big Hit Entertainment's "Hit it" auditions in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p>The lineup went through several changes before being finalised in 2012. Six months prior to debut, the members began to gain publicity through Twitter, video blogs, fancafe posts, and song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.
Before their debut, RM performed as an underground rapper and had released several tracks informally, including a collaboration with Zico.<p>
<br>
Jin was a film arts student at Konkuk University before being streetcast for auditions, while Suga was an underground rapper in Daegu. J-Hope, who was part of a street dance team named Neuron, was active in the underground dancing scene.[24] Before joining Big Hit, Jimin enrolled in Busan High School of Arts as the top student in modern dance, but later transferred to Korea Arts High School with V, who auditioned in Daegu.Jungkook was cast by seven agencies after auditioning for Superstar K, but eventually chose Big Hit, reportedly after watching fellow member RM rap

While it may not have been audible to viewers watching through television or streams, the moment the opening notes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdVXkSdhwU" target="_blank" title="DNA Official MV">"DNA"<a> began, Los Angeles' Microsoft Theater was flooded with fans screaming out the band members' names. This was the beginning of what is known as a "fan chant," which fans in Korea use as a way to actively support their favorite artists' performances on television and in concerts. Typically, <strong>the louder the <u>fan chant</u>, the more popular the act</strong> is and it helps audiences at home get a sense of what acts they should be watching. <p>In order to create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript.
